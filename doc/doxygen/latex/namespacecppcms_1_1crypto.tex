\subsection{Detailed Description}
This namespace holds basic cryptographic utilities useful for save interaction with user. One of the limitations of these functions is the fact that they do not use so called cryptographic memory, however it is not required as all secret keys are stored as plain text in configuration files, The only protection that is given is that values of keys are erased when the object is deleted to prevent key-\/leaks due to use of uninitialized memory in user applications.
